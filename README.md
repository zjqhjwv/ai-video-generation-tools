## FAQ

**Can AI video generators actually replace professional video production teams?**

For many use cases like social media content, training videos, and marketing clips, AI tools now match or exceed traditional production quality at fraction of the cost and time. However, high-budget commercial work, complex narratives, and projects requiring human nuance still benefit from professional crews. The sweet spot is using AI for volume content while reserving budgets for hero pieces that need human touch.

**Which AI video generators work best for someone with zero video editing experience?**

InVideo AI, Pictory, and Lumen5 require minimal learning curves since they work from text inputs and automate most decisions. Descript's document-style editing feels familiar to anyone who's edited Google Docs, making it approachable for beginners. HeyGen and Synthesia simplify avatar-based videos to just script writing and avatar selection. Start with free trials to find which interface clicks with your brain.

**How do pricing models work for AI video generation platforms?**

Most platforms offer free trials or limited free tiers, then charge monthly subscriptions ranging from $15-100+ depending on features and output volume. Credit-based systems like Runway charge per minute of generated video, which can get expensive quickly at professional usage levels. Enterprise platforms like Synthesia and DeepBrain use custom pricing for teams with API access and dedicated support. Factor in both subscription costs and per-video rendering fees when budgeting.
